## Software: *NKI-AI/direct*

The software seems to be primarily built and used by Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI). The point of the software is to be able to resolve imaging issues with MRIs. The software package uses PyTorch, a library in which much is geared towards neural networking. The Direct package is intended to work with models to train them to recover MRI images that experience "partially observed or noisy input data."
