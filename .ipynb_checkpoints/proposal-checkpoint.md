# Community Software Analysis Proposal
Please edit this file and push to your repository.

## Software: *statsmodels/statsmodels*

Statsmodels is the umbrella package, but I am going to focus my project on the Time Series Analysis module within Statsmodels (statsmodels.tsa). This model is for time series analysis using basic models such as autoregression models, vector autoregression models, Markov regression/autogression models, as well as others. I am most interested to explore the state space models within this module because I am interested in AI and have minor exposure to state space concepts and Hidden Markov Models. I am excited to learn how this compares to what I have seen and if this package can be utilized for the same or similar concepts.

### Install and run

Check the following boxes when complete or add a note below if you
encountered a problem.

- [x] I have installed the software
- [x] I have run at least one example
